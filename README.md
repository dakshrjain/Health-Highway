# Health-Highway
A system to reduce the communication gap between rural areas and city hospitals by helping  the medical assistants to use our application and extend the life expectancy of a patient and to create a Single point of contact for all health-related services.

**Abstract**

One of the basic vitalities of good living is quick access to essential services like health care. But many times it could mean a condition of life and death for an individual who is unable to get the access to these services. Thus an important part of social sector development is incomplete without adequate health care facilities. The quality of human health is the foundation upon which the realization of life goals and objectives of a persona, the community or nation as whole depends. It is both an end and means of development strategy. The relationship between health and development is mutually reinforcing- while health contributes to economic development, economic development, in turn, tends to improve the health status of the population in a country. India as a nation has been growing economically at a rapid pace particularly after the advent of New Economic Policy of 1991. However, this rapid economic development has not been accompanied by social development particularly health sector development. Health sector has been accorded very low priority in terms of allocation of resources. Public expenditure on health is less than 1 per cent of GDP in India. 

Health systems and polices have a critical role in determining the manner in which health services are delivered, utilized and affect health outcomes. ‘Health' being a state subject, despite the issuance of the guidelines by the central government, the final prerogative on implementation of the initiatives on healthcare lies with the states. This report briefly describes the public health structure in the country and traces the evolution of the major health programs and initiatives in rural health. By this project we are basically aiming for creating such a system which would help the people of the rural area to directly communicate with the City Hospitals removing the communication gap between them and improving the quality of health in those areas.

**Motivation**

Report on the Health Survey and Development Committee, commonly referred to as the Bhore Committee Report, 1946, has been a landmark report for India, from which the current health policy and systems have evolved.1 The recommendation for threetiered health-care system to provide preventive and curative health care in rural and urban areas placing health workers on government payrolls and limiting the need for private practitioners became the principles on which the current public health-care systems were founded. This was done to ensure that access to primary care is independent of individual socioeconomic conditions. However, lack of capacity of public health systems to provide access to quality care resulted in a simultaneous evolution of the private health-care systems with a constant and gradual expansion of private health-care services.

Although the first national population program was announced in 1951, the first National Health Policy of India (NHP) got formulated only in 1983 with its main focus on provision of primary health care to all by 2000. It prioritized setting up a network of primary health-care services using health volunteers and simple technologies establishing well-functioning referral systems and an integrated network of specialty facilities. NHP 2002 further built on NHP 1983, with an objective of provision of health services to the general public through decentralization, use of private sector and increasing public expenditure on health care overall.4 It also emphasized on increasing the use of non-allopathic form of medicines such as ayurveda, unani and siddha, and a need for strengthening decision-making processes at decentralized state level.

**Conclusion**

India has been focusing on providing comprehensive care to people living in Ruralareas. It has framed policies that allow the design and implementation of programs on
viral diseases care in an inclusive manner. However, looking at the pace ofachievements of the targets so far and future targets, it needs to focus more on framingof the policies in terms of building capacity of existing human resources, enhancingfurther allocation of finances dedicated toward rural healthcare services, identifyingareas through operational research, which can enhance quantity and quality of care forhealthcare in India. The path is set and we need to operationalize and move forward.
